# predictive-oil-rig
This project implements a predictive maintenance system for oil rigs using machine learning. It predicts when maintenance is required based on sensor data such as corrosion levels, pressure, and temperature. The system integrates with a simulated blockchain to track and log maintenance events securely and transparently.
